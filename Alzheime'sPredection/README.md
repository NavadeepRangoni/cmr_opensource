# Alzheimer's Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for predicting Alzheimer's disease using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide. Early detection can significantly impact treatment efficacy. This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict Alzheimer's disease based on demographic, genetic, and clinical data.
